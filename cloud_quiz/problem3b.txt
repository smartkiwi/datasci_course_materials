-- load the test file into Pig
--raw = LOAD 's3n://uw-cse-344-oregon.aws.amazon.com/cse344-test-file' USING TextLoader as (line:chararray);
-- later you will load to other files, example:
raw = LOAD 's3n://uw-cse-344-oregon.aws.amazon.com/btc-2010-chunk-000' USING TextLoader as (line:chararray); 

-- parse each line into ntriples
ntriples = foreach raw generate FLATTEN(myudfs.RDFSplit3(line)) as (subject:chararray,predicate:chararray,object:chararray);


--a  = filter ntriples by (subject matches '.*business.*');
a  = filter ntriples by (subject matches '.*rdfabout\\.com.*');

b  = foreach a generate subject as subject2,predicate as predicate2,object as object2 ;

--joined = join a by subject, b by subject2;
joined = join a by object, b by subject2;

-- store the results in the folder /user/hadoop/problem3b-results
--store result into 'problem3b-results' using PigStorage();
store result into '/user/hadoop/problem3b-results' using PigStorage();
-- Alternatively, you can store the results in S3, see instructions:
-- store count_by_object_ordered into 's3n://superman/example-results';
