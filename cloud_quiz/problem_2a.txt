---Problem 2A - Histogram:

register s3n://uw-cse-344-oregon.aws.amazon.com/myudfs.jar

-- load the test file into Pig
raw = LOAD 's3n://uw-cse-344-oregon.aws.amazon.com/cse344-test-file' USING TextLoader as (line:chararray);
-- later you will load to other files, example:
--raw = LOAD 's3n://uw-cse-344-oregon.aws.amazon.com/btc-2010-chunk-000' USING TextLoader as (line:chararray); 

-- parse each line into ntriples
ntriples = foreach raw generate FLATTEN(myudfs.RDFSplit3(line)) as (subject:chararray,predicate:chararray,object:chararray);

--group the n-triples by object column
subjects = group ntriples by (subject) PARALLEL 50;

-- flatten the objects out (because group by produces a tuple of each object
-- in the first column, and we want each object ot be a string, not a tuple),
-- and count the number of tuples associated with each object



count_by_subject = foreach subjects generate flatten($0), COUNT($1) as count PARALLEL 50;


counts_group = group count_by_subject by (count) PARALLEL 50;



hist = foreach counts_group generate flatten($0) as x, COUNT($1) as y PARALLEL 50;




--order the resulting tuples by their count in descending order
hist_ordered = order hist by (x)  PARALLEL 50;

-- store the results in the folder /user/hadoop/problem2a-results
store hist_ordered into '/user/hadoop/problem2b-results' using PigStorage();
-- Alternatively, you can store the results in S3, see instructions:
-- store count_by_object_ordered into 's3n://superman/example-results';
